              I'm a passionate MERN Stack developer and a dedicated student, currently building my skills in creating responsive, user-friendly web applications. I specialize in working with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, and I love bringing ideas to life through clean, functional, and modern web design. I’m constantly learning, building projects, and exploring the latest trends in web development to grow as a full-stack developer.

              My journey began as an IT Engineering student at LD College of Engineering, but my real passion ignited when I discovered the power of combining technology with design. I believe great software isn’t just about writing clean code—it's about crafting meaningful experiences that delight users and solve real-world problems. Every project I work on is a step forward in my journey as a creative and purposeful developer.

                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, 
                contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the 
                developer community through blog posts and speaking engagements.
